Everyone in the party concedes that it is Biden’s decision — and his alone — whether to continue his reelection bid. 
But the self-professed congenital optimist now finds himself trying to convince a party that has grown increasingly pessimistic, 
with an increasing number of Democrats fearful that unless things change, Republicans are poised for a landslide victory and 
Donald Trump is headed for the White House.

But in the eyes of a president who often relishes the mentality of an underdog, he has taken a posture of Joe Biden Against 
the World (or at least some in his party).

Biden in recent days has held several rallies aimed at showing that he still has the enthusiastic support of the party’s rank-and-file. 
But those events contrasted starkly with the somber mood outside, creating a challenge for skeptics who are pointing to less-tangible 
indicators like troubling polls, mounting defections and withheld donations.
